## Project Overview

EMPYRA is a comprehensive Employee Management System built with Angular (using Material UI) for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend, with MySQL as the database. The system leverages REST APIs to facilitate seamless communication between the frontend and backend components, with API documentation automatically generated using SwaggerUI.

To enhance user experience during employee data entry, EMPYRA integrates with the Restful Countries API, providing intelligent suggestions for country-related fields. The system also features advanced data visualization capabilities powered by Chart.js, presenting key metrics such as employee joining trends over time, department-wise average age and ratings, and geographical distribution of employees across cities, states, and countries.

The analytics module takes this a step further by feeding the visualized data to the OpenRouter API, which accesses DeepSeek V3 0324 to generate actionable insights. These AI-powered insights include key findings, strategic recommendations, emerging trends, and potential opportunities specific to your organizational data.
